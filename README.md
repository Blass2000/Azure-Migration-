**Intorduction**

By following these steps and leveraging Azureâ€™s comprehensive tools and frameworks, organizations can ensure a successful and secure migration to the cloud.

ðŸ”· Understand the Cloud Adoption Framework
Begin by exploring the Cloud Adoption Framework. This framework provides comprehensive documentation, best practices, and guidance to prepare for cloud migration. Itâ€™s crucial for reviewing and optimizing existing Azure environments to enhance management and security.

ðŸ”· Leverage the Well-Architected Framework
Incorporate the Well-Architected Framework, which offers technical guidance to harden, optimize, and secure your Azure environment. Integrated directly into Azure, this framework aids in improving cost posture, security, reliability, operational excellence, and performance.

Wait a sec.... just for the project leaders, so we will be on the same page 

ðŸ”· When talking about the topic of cloud computing services, you must have heard of these concepts, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). They are the three major service categories provided by cloud providers. It is important to understand what they are and what is the difference between them because they will appear on various occasions where cloud computing services are discussed.

The above code will create the IAM role for the master and worker nodes and attach the necessary policy to it.
Create outputs.tf file and add the below code to it.
# IAM Wokrer Node Instance Profile 
output "instance_profile" {
  value = aws_iam_instance_profile.worker.name
}

# IAM Role Master's ARN
output "master_arn" {
  value = aws_iam_role.master.arn
}

# IAM Role Worker's ARN
output "worker_arn" {
  value = aws_iam_role.worker.arn
}
